# Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)

This is not really in the spirit of the challenge, but I wanted to mess around and have some experience calling unmanaged code.

Allows us to interact with unmanaged libraries from our managed code. What is managed versus unmanaged code? From .NET perspective, here is a super high level explanation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-managed-and-unmanaged-code-in-net/

If you are a beginner, this will require some reading and learning about your operating system (in my case Windows), lower level programming concepts, type marshalling, and interacting with unmanaged code from C#. These are just a few resources to get started.
