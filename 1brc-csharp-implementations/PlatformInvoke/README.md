Allows us to interact with unmanaged libraries from our managed code. What is managed versus unmanaged code? From .NET perspective, here is a super high level explanation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-managed-and-unmanaged-code-in-net/

If you are a beginner, this will require some reading and learning about your operating system (in this case Windows), lower level programming concepts, type marshalling, and interacting with unmanaged code from C#. These are just a few resources to get started.
